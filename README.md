# CinemaWebsite
This is a website built in c# .net to display movies to users. We have release date filters as well as search engines for movie information and genres. For each movie information we are using API to get the actual number of reviews from IMDB via Ajax. Users can log in or register to the system and comment or rate the movie they want.
